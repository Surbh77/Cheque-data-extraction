# Cheque data extraction
Cheque data extraction is a process that involves capturing and interpreting essential information from a physical or digital cheque. Utilizing advanced optical character recognition (OCR) technology, this method extracts key details such as the payee's name, amount, date, and account information. The extracted data is then digitized and organized for efficient record-keeping, reducing manual data entry errors and streamlining financial transactions. This automated process enhances the accuracy and speed of cheque processing, contributing to more efficient and secure financial operations for businesses and financial institutions.
